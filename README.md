# Birthday Reminder App

This project is a reminder app which allows you to keep track of your loved ones' birthdays. Features include adding birthdays, viewing people's profiles, seeing upcoming birthdays and searching through all birthdays. 

This app was built in Expo's platform using React Native- a UI software framework that allows developers to build web, iOS and Android applications. It utilizes async storage to save information and react-navigation to traverse through the screens.
It has not been published to any app store as of yet and is in beta testing.
